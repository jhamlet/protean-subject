Summary
-------

**<%-pkg.fullname%>** is an **Rx.Subject** that allows for easily creating new
subjects through subclassing by not having to implement all of a subject's methods.

The main methods that may be overwritten to accomlish the subject behavior you
desire are:

* `next(value)` Called when the subject is `onNext`ed
* `error(error)` Called when the subject is `onError`ed
* `completed()` Called when the subject is `onCompleted`
* `subscribed(observer)` Called when an observer subscribes to the subject
* `errorOnSubscribe(observer)` Called when the subject is in an error state and an
  observer subscribes
* `completedOnSubscribed(observer)` Called when the subject is in a completed state
  and an observer subscribes

The falling methods you should use when ready to notify the subject's observers:

* `notifyNext(value)`
* `notifyError(error)`
* `notifyCompleted()`

For more information see the [API documentation](%-links.apiDoc%>).
